Data Reorganization/Locality:
	Organizes the work so that less memory transfers are needed 
	
OSNAP Pin Recovery Tool:
tool that can return pin # from a cryptographically hashed copy

Crypto Hash: one way functions, output should appear random, Limited outputs-known finite length

how might we undo:
	brute force: for each possible pin compute hash and on match display pin
